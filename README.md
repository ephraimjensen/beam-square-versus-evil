# Overview

In this game, you control a blue square with the 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' keys. You can press spacebar to attack in a beam in the direction you are facing. Green enemies will spawn randomly on the screen. If you touch an enemy, you will die and lose the game. You can destroy enemies by hitting them with your beam attack.

I wrote this game to learn how to use object-oriented programming in python, to practice quickly planning and executing on an idea for a program, and to practice transforming ideas into a working prototype quickly, modularly, and iteratively.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to develop this program. I consulted multiple online resources including ChatGPT aid me in learning to make this game.

I programmed this game in Python, using the Pygame module heavily. I also used the time and random modules.
